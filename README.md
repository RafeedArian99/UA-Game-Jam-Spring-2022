You've decided to participate in the UA Game Jam for Spring 2022! Unfortunately, you have to submit your project by 3 PM, and it is currently 2:59 PM. Using the OSCR cart you grabbed from the Main Library, get to the Gould-Simpson building using whatever means possible, even if it means you have to... _break the rules ;)_
